        <p>Hi! I'm sarah. I am a computer science student at University of San Francisco (USF).
            Previously, I served as program manager of Women in Tech at USF and worked as an educator for 7+ years.</p>
        <div class="indent">
            <p>🧑🏾‍🔧 I'm interested in software engineering or security engineering roles</p>
            <p>💜 I would love to work in edu/public/climate tech (or at least on technology that doesn't make the world
                worse)</p>
            <p>🍞🥖🥯🥐 I enjoy bread</p>
            <p>🪡 And on the rare occasions that I have free time, I sew costumes and learn Arabic</p>
            <p>🧿 <b>hatsh3p</b> is a play on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatshepsut">Hatshepsut</a> and a
                reference to my identity as an Egyptian-American.</p>
